<h1>About Me</h1>

<p style="font-size:18px">
    I am a PhD student of Robotics Department at University of Michigan (<a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/" target="_blank">UMich</a>), where I work on legged robot control and learning with professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yanranding/home/" target="_blank">Yanran Ding</a> and previously collaborated with Dr. Maani Ghaffari and Dr. Elena Shrestha.
    Prior to that, I received my master and bachelor degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (<a href="https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">SJTU</a>), majoring in Mechanical Engineering. I had a great research experience on industrial manipulators.

<p style="font-size:18px">
    I am particularly interested in <b>agile legged locomotion</b> in dynamic environments, with a focus on <b>control and learning</b> methods,
    and proficient in developing <b>efficient and deployable</b> robotic algorithms.
    When I'm not immersed in technology, you can find me swimming or playing badminton.
