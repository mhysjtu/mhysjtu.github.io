<h1>About Me</h1>

<p style="font-size:18px">
    I am a PhD student of Robotics Department at University of Michigan (<a href="https://robotics.umich.edu/" target="_blank">UMich</a>), where I work on legged robot control and learning with professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yanranding/home/" target="_blank">Yanran Ding</a> and previously collaborated with Dr. Maani Ghaffari and Dr. Elena Shrestha.
    Prior to that, I received my bachelor degree from Southern University of Science and Technology (<a href="https://mee.sustech.edu.cn/en" target="_blank">SUSTech</a>), majoring in Robotics Engineering. Advised by professor <a href="https://www.wzhanglab.site/members/" target="_blank">Wei Zhang</a>, I had a great research experience on MPC and RL of quadruped robots.

    I am particularly interested in <b>agile legged locomotion</b> in dynamic environments, with a focus on <b>control and learning</b> methods,
    and proficient in developing <b>efficient and deployable</b> robotic algorithms.
    When I'm not immersed in technology, you can find me swimming or playing badminton.
